<h1>Project definition</h1>

Purpose of the application is to show how 2 different path finding algorithms compare to each others. The application witll have a web based gui made with react but rest of the main application will be running in Spring Java.

<h2>Used programming languages</h2>

In the project main languages that will be used are Java and JavaScript. Language that i can also read in a reasonable amount include Python.

<h2>Used Algorithms</h2>

In the project i will be implementing Jump Point Search (JPS) and Dijkstras algorithms.

<h2>Inputs and outputs</h2>

Still under planning but most likely will be using some excisting mapping data where user can pick a map from the gui and output will be a visual representation alongside with statistics of how the two algorithms compare.

<h2>Course related information</h2>

Im part of the Tietojenk√§sittelytieteen kandidaatti (TKT).

<h2>Project language</h2>
