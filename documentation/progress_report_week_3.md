[Hour reporting](https://github.com/Branuz/Algorithm-project-2022/blob/main/documentation/hour_reporting.md)

<h2>What happened during week 3</h2>

* Made interactive map for frontend.
* Started creating tests for backend.
* Made the connection for the data flow between front and back to work as intented.

Spend most of the time figuring out a way to create a interactive grid for the front where the user can select the start and end points for the algorithms and create obstacles/maze for the algorithm to find a way around. Also started to create the visualisation for the data flow to be shown. Started creating first unit tests for the application. Next weeks goal is to finish up the frontend of the application so that the algorithms search can be viewed in real time and begin the implementation of the second algorithm.
