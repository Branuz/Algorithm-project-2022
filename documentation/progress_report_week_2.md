<h1>Progress Report: Week 2</h1>

[Hour reporting](https://github.com/Branuz/Algorithm-project-2022/blob/main/documentation/hour_reporting.md)

<h2>What happened during week 2</h2>

* Made react frontend structure and connected it with backend.
* Made sure spring backend can send working json data to frontend and use it.
* Added first implementation for dijkstras.

Was sick during the beginning of the week so was not able to add as much new functionaility as i originally planned. But started setting up the first algorithm and made a working frontend with the spring backend and made sure data can be transferred there for visualisation in the future once the first algorithm has been properly made. Didnt have time to add any testing yet since im still at the stages of making everything work. Will start creating tests next week once the first algorithm is working as intented.
